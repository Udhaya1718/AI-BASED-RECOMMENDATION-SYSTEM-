This project is about building an AI-powered recommendation system using Java and the Apache Mahout library.


---

Objective:

To recommend products or content to a user based on what similar users have liked or rated highly.


---
 How It Works:

1. User Ratings Data:

The system takes user-item rating data (e.g., which user liked which product and how much).



2. Similarity Calculation:

It uses Pearson correlation to find users with similar preferences.



3. Recommendation Generation:

It identifies items liked by similar users that the current user hasnâ€™t tried.

Predicts how much the current user might like those items.Technologies Used:

Java: Programming language to build the logic.

Apache Mahout: Library used for machine learning and collaborative filtering.

CSV File: Stores user-item ratings like:
userID,itemID,rating
